# 4Brittany
Initial issue(s)

1. the "wobble" when you scroll/swipe the avatars
* this test is primarily to (a) fix that issue; (b) work out how we share code back and forth

2. please ignore this error ... the trivial fix creates other issues :(
* UINavigationBar decoded as unlocked for UINavigationController, or navigationBar delegate set up incorrectly.
